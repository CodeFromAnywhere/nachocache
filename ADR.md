Some parameters in an api make it deterministically different and some don't. For example, an API key does usually not affect the result if it's a generic function, but if it's a endpoint to retrieve info about the user, it does.

If we can automatically figure out which parameters in an api endpoint are deterministic differentiators of the result, we know what to cache. If we also automatically can figure out which parameters are secrets that do differentiate, we can obfuscate them if we can't remove them.

If we would have this for any API, it would become possible to access a much wider range of resources that have already been generated by APIs. One person can now generate something, thousands can make use of the resource.

To put it one step further, a follow up step could be to add a great search algo on top of these cached assets. Now we can find caches that are similar to what we need. No exact match needed! Similar enough? Great! Use it. If not, we can still choose to generate it, or find a different path to rome.
